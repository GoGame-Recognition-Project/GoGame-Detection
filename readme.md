## üìç Overview

This project is dedicated to the development of a program capable of recognizing a game board, its stones and their respective positions within a go game context from a video stream.
The primary problem that our project tackles is the detection of the game setup at different angles without the need to set the camera at a fixed configuration. This capability allows for flexibility in changing the camera's angle or position, as well as adjusting the game board's placement during the course of the game. This stands as a distinctive feature compared to many existing solutions.


Key Highlights:
- **Automated Recognition:** Utilizes cutting-edge computer vision techniques to automatically recognize the positions of black and white stones on the Go board.
- **Real-time Processing:** Capable of processing live video feeds, allowing for real-time tracking of Go game progress.
- **Intuitive Visualization:** Generates visual representations of Go game positions, providing a clear and concise view of the board at different stages.

Whether you're a Go enthusiast, a developer exploring computer vision applications, or someone curious about the intersection of AI and traditional board games, GoGame-Detection offers an engaging and educational experience.
