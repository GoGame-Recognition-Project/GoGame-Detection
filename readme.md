## üìç Overview

This project is dedicated to the development of a program capable of recognizing a game board, its stones and their respective positions within a go game context from a video stream.
The primary problem that our project tackles is the detection of the game setup at different angles without the need to set the camera at a fixed configuration. This capability allows for flexibility in changing the camera's angle or position, as well as adjusting the game board's placement during the course of the game. This stands as a distinctive feature compared to many existing solutions.


Key Highlights:
- **Real-time Game recognition:** Capable of detecting key components of a go game using a custom trained `Yolov8` model.
- **Game management:** Capable of streaming and visually reproducing a Go game with or without respecting the Go game rules.
- **SGF:** Capable of saving an SGF file of the streamed game for later use. 
- .
- **Intuitive Visualization:** An interactive user interface has been developed on the base of this project. The interface takes the form of a website, housed in a separate repository. Feel free to explore it by clicking here.

# GoGame-Detection

GoGame-Detection is a Python project for playing the traditional board game Go, combining computer vision and machine learning techniques. The project includes modules for board detection, game logic, and visualization.

## Files

### 1. GoBoard.py
- **Purpose:** Implements the `GoBoard` class, which represents the game board and its state.
- **Key Features:**
  - Applies perspective transformation to the input frame.
  - Assigns stones to intersections based on their proximity.
  - Processes frames and extracts information about the Go board.

### 2. GoGame.py
- **Purpose:** Manages the game state, detects moves, and interfaces with the Sente library for Go game logic.
- **Key Features:**
  - Initializes the game with instances of the Sente game, a Go board detector, and a Go visualizer.
  - Processes frames and updates the game state.
  - Provides methods for playing moves, correcting stone positions, and obtaining the SGF representation.

### 3. GoVisual.py
- **Purpose:** Creates a visual representation of the Go game based on a Sente game instance.
- **Key Features:**
  - Navigates through the game using methods like `previous` and `next`.
  - Displays the initial, final, and current positions on the board.
  - Draws the Go game board with stones and highlights the last move.
